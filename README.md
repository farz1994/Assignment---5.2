1.Calculate the P Value for the test in Problem 2.

2.How do you test the proportions and compare against hypothetical props? Test Hypothesis: proportion of automatic cars is 40.

Null Hypothesis : Ho , P = 0.4
Alternate Hypothesis : Ha, P is not equal to 0.4
Alpha = 0.05
Probability (p): p = 1 - Î±/2 = 0.975
Z value = 1.6449

Calculated P value is greater than alpha, hence we accept the null Hypothesis.

P value = 0.4
